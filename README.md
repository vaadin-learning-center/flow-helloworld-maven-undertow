# Nano Vaadin - Ramp up in a second.
A nano project to start a Vaadin project. Perfect for Micro-UIs packed as fat jar in a docker image.

## target of this project
The target of this project is a minimal rampup time for a first hello world.
Why we need one more HelloWorld? Well, the answer is quite easy. 
If you have to try something out, or you want to make a small POC to present something,
there is no time and budget to create a demo project.
You don´t want to copy paste all small things together.
Here you will get a Nano-Project that will give you all in a second.

Clone the repo and start editing the class ```VaadinApp```.
Nothing more. 


Happy Coding.
